# Salesforce DX Project: Coding Challenge

## Description

A repo containing my coding challenge results in SFDX format (also includes a package.xml for easier push/pull)

## Requirements/Dependencies

This solution requires that State/Country picklists are active and configured, per the following [article](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?language=en_US&id=sf.admin_state_country_picklists_configure.htm&type=5).

For security, please assign the included Permission Set "Coding Challenge" to you user in order to have access to the solution; LWCs are available in the provided Lightning Page "Zip Code Coding Challenge"
